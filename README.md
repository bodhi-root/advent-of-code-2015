# Advent of Code 2015

What do you do when you want more [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) problems but you have to wait until tomorrow's comes out?  You go back and do problems from previous years!

I started this one during Christmas 2020 and then finished it up during Christmas 2021.

These problems were relatively easy compared to other years.  The only one that I got stuck on was Problem 19B.  I had to go to the Reddit forums and find some help on that one.
